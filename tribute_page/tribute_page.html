    There are few pop culture franchises more intimidating to the uninitiated than Star Trek. While "Beam me up, Scotty" and the Vulcan hand salute have worked their way into the mainstream lexicon, it can feel virtually impossible to find a way into the expansive franchise, which spans seven live-action TV shows, one lesser-known animated series, and 13 feature films, including the three rebooted films.

    <h2 id="headline">A quick overview of Star Trek’s 50-year journey through space</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Star Trek: The Original Series</strong>
        The basic: Ran for three seasons (79 episodes) from 1966 to 1969;
        The premise: A five-year mission of space exploration in the 23rd century. The first Star Trek series is still the most iconic in the eyes of many fans, and its characters will be familiar to anyone who has seen the rebooted Trek films.</li>
      <li><strong>Star Trek: The Next Generation</strong>The basics: Ran for seven seasons (178 episodes) from 1987 to 1994.
The set up: A continuing mission of space exploration in the 24th century.
To open up new storytelling possibilities, the first Star Trek spinoff series takes place a century after Kirk’s original five-year mission.</li>
      <li><strong>Star Trek: Deep Space Nine</strong>The basics: Ran for seven seasons (176 episodes) from 1993 to 1999.
The set up: A space station on the edge of civilization in the 24th century. Rather than take place on a traveling ship, the next Star Trek spinoff series is set on a space station called Deep Space Nine, a stationary hub located on the edge of Federation space. </li>
      <li><strong>Star Trek: Voyager</strong>The basics: Ran for seven seasons (172 episodes) from 1995 to 2001.
The set up: A lone 24th-century ship stranded 70,000 light-years from Earth. Voyager kicked off with a "lost in space" concept that seemed to promise more of the complex serialized storytelling that had come to define Deep Space Nine. Instead, the show pulled from the episodic Next Generation model: A mostly amiable group of explorers spend their time meeting new alien cultures and dealing with space phenomena.</li>
      <li><strong>Star Trek: Enterprise</strong>The basics: Ran for four seasons (98 episodes) from 2001 to 2005.
The set up: A prequel set in the 22nd century.
Enterprise is set roughly 100 years before Kirk’s original five-year mission, this prequel takes place on the original Enterprise, Earth’s first Warp 5–capable ship.</li>
      <li><strong>Star Trek: Discovery</strong> Discovery is set roughly a decade before the events of the original Star Trek series, and follows the crew of the USS Discovery during the Federation–Klingon war. </li>
    </ul>
